/**
 * Picks the side panel's content by panel kind: a `conv:<id>` panel opens a
 * conversation projection (Mechanism B), every other id is a stream/thread/draft
 * handled by {@link StreamPanel}. Both stream.tsx and board.tsx host the panel
 * through this, so either surface can open either kind. Keyed on the panel id so
 * switching targets remounts cleanly — except a draft thread promoted to its real
 * stream, which keeps the draft's key so the panel carries its state across the
 * handoff instead of remounting. Hosts must not key this element themselves: an
 * outer `key={panelId}` unmounts the whole host on promotion, before the key
 * below can preserve anything.
